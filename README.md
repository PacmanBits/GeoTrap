#GeoTrap
Place a trap at your current location.  If other players try to leave traps at the same location, you get the points!

##Playing
Create an account and log in.  Once logged in, either press "Set Trap" to set a trap or "Update" to update the map.

##Rules
Traps are placed using geo-location.  Each covers a 500 meter radius.  

Catching players in a trap gets you 3 points - getting caught in someone else's penalizes 2.  You may leave one trap at a time.  Each trap can be sprung up to 3 times before it has to be set again.

##The Map
Your current location is indicated by a green dot.  If you have an active trap, it will be displayed as a blue circle.  The black circle around your current location represents the radius of a trap layed there.  Enemy traps are only shown if triggered.

##Coming Soon
